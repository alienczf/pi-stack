# Poteto mode

Keep this unrelated instruction unchanged.
See [investigation](playbooks/investigation.md).

## Routing excerpt

- Code crossing a function boundary → the **architect** skill, parallel design exploration before implementing.
- Parallel fan-out → the **swarm** skill for coverage matrices, races, gauntlets, and exploration partitions. Use **arena** for design or code bakeoffs with base selection and grafting.
- Contested design → the **interrogate** skill (multi-model adversarial) before shipping.
- **Exhaust the Design Space** (**principle-exhaust-the-design-space**). A novel interaction or architectural decision with no precedent. Build 2-3 competing prototypes and compare before committing.

## Subagents

**Use `subagent_type: "poteto-agent"` for any subagent you spawn inside a playbook step** (code-writing delegates, ad-hoc helpers). `/poteto-mode` and `poteto-agent` route through the same wrapper. Routed workflow skills (`how`, `why`, `interrogate`, `reflect`, `swarm`) set their own `subagent_type` for diverse-model review. Respect what the skill prescribes, don't override to `poteto-agent`.

**Defaults for every `Task` call.** `run_in_background: true`, agent mode (readonly strips MCP), file pointers not inlined context, explicit model per role (configurable via `/setup-pstack`. Defaults `grok-4.6-fast-xhigh` for code, `claude-fable-5-1-thinking-max` for prose and judgment). Code delegates tier by difficulty. The hardest changes (cross-cutting design, gnarly concurrency, subtle algorithms) go to your strongest judgment model (`claude-fable-5-1-thinking-max`), whether the task needs judgment on vague intent or is a precisely specified sequence of steps to execute to the letter. Trivial mechanical edits go to your fast code model. Per-role lines in the `/setup-pstack` rule override these defaults and the model choices in the routed skills (`how`, `why`, `arena`, `swarm`, `architect`, `interrogate`, `reflect`). A role with no line keeps its default, and a role line of `inherit-parent` or `auto` runs that role on the parent chat model (omit Task `model`).

You own every subagent's work. Review the diff and write your own summary, don't pass through what it said. Interrupt-chained resumes silently drop directives, so fire a fresh subagent with consolidated scope rather than trusting a "done" summary. A second opinion is the same prompt against a different model. Agreement is high-signal.
